/**
 * Represents a command belonging to a command set.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The BaseListViewCommandSet extension type exposes generalized commands that may be displayed as tool bar buttons,
 * context menu items, etc. These commands are initially defined in the extension’s manifest file. At runtime, the
 * corresponding Command object can be obtained by calling {@link BaseListViewCommandSet.tryGetCommand}.
 * The command’s appearance can be customized by assigning its properties, for example to hide a command that is not
 * contextually relevant, or to pluralize the title based on the number of selected items.
