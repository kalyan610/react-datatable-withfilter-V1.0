/**
 * `createClassResolver` is a factory function which creates a state to classmap resolver for
 * slot specific class names. It can be used in conjunction with the `compose` option `classes` to
 * inject css modules without writing cx(...) logic manually distributing classnames.
 *
 * Class names which map to slots are automatically distributed to correct slot props.
 *
 * Class names with an underscore are interpretted as enum matchable classes. For example,
 * the class "size_large" would be applied to the `root` slot when the component's state contains
 * a prop `size` with a value `large`.
 *
 * Remaining class names would be interpretted as modifiers, applied to the `root` slot when
 * the component `state` contains a truthy matching prop name.
